        Hi, my name is Rodion. I was born and raised in Kazakhstan,
        in a hot and very beautiful city - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Шымкент">Shymkent</a>.

        <p>I graduated from 11th grade with a physical and mathematical bias.
        While studying at school, I was actively involved in athletics and won 
        prizes in competitions. I have also been studying English for several years.</p>
        At the moment I am studying at <a href="https://kpfu.ru/"> KFU</a>,
        Institute of Computational Mathematics and Information Systems.
        Looking for myself, trying everything new ;)
